    "grep": ("Search file contents for literal text inside the workspace. Use this to " "find symbols, strings, and call sites before editing."),
    "glob": ("Find workspace paths with a glob pattern. Use this to locate files by name " "or extension; use grep when you need to search file contents."),
    "tree": ("Show a bounded directory tree. Use this for orientation when you need the " "project layout, not for reading file contents."),
    "git_status": ("Show concise git working tree status. Use before or after edits to see " "changed files without reading diffs."),
    "git_diff": ("Show unstaged or staged git diff. Use to review pending changes before " "summarizing, testing, or committing."),
    "git_log": ("Show recent git commit history, optionally scoped to a path. Use when " "history helps explain current behavior or conventions."),
    "diagnostics": ("Run a project verification command such as tests, lint, or typecheck. Use " "for validation; results are evidence returned to the model for deciding the next step."),
    "think": ("Record brief private scratch reasoning without touching the filesystem. Use " "sparingly for planning or debugging; do not put long user-facing narration here."),

    "ask_user": ("Ask the user for required information and pause the turn. Use only when the " "answer cannot be safely discovered from the workspace or commands."),
    "write": ("Write a UTF-8 text file in the workspace. Use for new files or full-file " "replacement; prefer edit or apply_patch for targeted changes."),
    "edit": ("Replace a specific UTF-8 text snippet in one workspace file. Use for precise " "single-file edits after reading the target file."),
    "delete": ("Delete a workspace file or directory. Use only when deletion is explicitly " "required; directories require recursive=true."),

    "shell": (
        "Run a shell command in the workspace for validation, project scripts, and "
        "data/toolchain inspection. Prefer dedicated tools for ordinary reading, "

        "npm/pnpm/yarn test, go test, cargo test, make test), inspect SQLite files "
        "with sqlite3 or Python sqlite3, process XLSX files with Python/openpyxl, "

    "python_exec": ("Run short Python code in the workspace. Use for focused data inspection or " "small scripts; prefer project tests and dedicated tools when available."),
    "fetch": ("Fetch a URL and return bounded text content. Use only when network access is " "needed and the URL is relevant to the task."),
    "web_search": ("Search the web for current external information. Use only when local files " "are insufficient or the user asks for up-to-date information."),
    "delegate": (
